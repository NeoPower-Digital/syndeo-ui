**Syndeo** is a decentralized platform that **motivates people to contribute to organizations by allowing members to award each other points**. The organization admins can then distribute treasury funds to members based on their points. This creates a **fair and transparent way to recognize people's contributions in organizations**, making the process **democratic and decentralized**.
